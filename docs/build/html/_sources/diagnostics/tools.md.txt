# **Tools**

- **Spectrum Analyzer:** For observing noise patterns and identifying affected frequencies. Options include:
    
    - Bench models.
        
    - Portable models like the TinySA Ultra.
        
- **Software-Defined Radio (SDR):** Many radios with SDR capabilities offer spectrum views of the received bandwidth, subject to the Nyquist limit.  The RX888 with ka9q-radio and ka9q-web can display up to 60 MHz bandwidth.
    
- **Portable AM Radio:** For triangulating nearby noise sources.
    
- **Loop Antenna:** For locating and nulling radiated noise.
    
- **Current Probe:** For measuring common-mode currents on cables.
    
- **Multimeter/Oscilloscope:** For identifying ground loop potential differences.
