# **Use Cases and Decision Trees**

## **Use Case 1: Observing a Noise "Hump" on the Spectrum Display (3-6 MHz)**

1. **Initial Observation:**
    
    - Wideband hump appearing between 3-6 MHz.
        
    - Noise consistent across multiple antennas or locations.
        
2. **Step 1:** Ask: Does the noise change with antenna orientation?
    
    - **Yes:** Likely radiated noise. Proceed with directional antenna to locate source.
        
    - **No:** Likely due to feedline radiation or ground loops. Proceed to Step 2.
        
    - **Rationale:** Radiated noise typically changes with antenna orientation, while feedline or ground loop noise does not.
        
3. **Step 2:** Disconnect the antenna from the feedline.
    
    - **Noise persists:** Indicates common-mode ingress. Apply ferrite chokes and test again.
        
    - **Noise disappears:** Check antenna connections for faults.
        
    - **Rationale:** Disconnecting the antenna isolates feedline and common-mode issues from radiated sources.
        
4. **Step 3:** Short the antenna at the feedline.
    
    - **Noise persists:** Confirms common-mode ingress.
        
    - **Noise disappears:** Investigate antenna radiation pattern or environment.
        
    - **Rationale:** Shorting removes antenna effects, isolating feedline ingress.
        
5. **Step 4:** Test with a different antenna.
    
    - **Noise persists:** Source is likely external to the antenna.
        
    - **Noise disappears:** Indicates antenna-specific issue.
        
    - **Rationale:** A different antenna tests for equipment or environment-specific noise.
        
6. **Step 5:** Use an AM radio near suspected devices (e.g., switching power supplies, LEDs).
    
    - Identify noisy devices and apply shielding or replacement.
        
    - **Rationale:** AM radios are sensitive to localized noise and help pinpoint specific devices.
        

## **Use Case 2: Intermittent Pulsing Noise on HF Bands**

1. **Initial Observation:**
    
    - Pulsed bursts on specific frequencies, appearing sporadically.
        
2. **Step 1:** Identify nearby devices as potential sources of noise (Wi-Fi routers, baby monitors, appliances).
    
    - Check for candidate devices by noting what is powered nearby.
        
    - **Rationale:** Nearby electronic devices emitting pulsed signals are common sources of intermittent noise.
        
3. **Step 2:** Correlate noise with specific devices:
    
    - **Turn devices off and on:** Observe whether the noise stops and starts synchronously.
        
    - **Move devices:** Relocate the suspected device and observe any change in noise intensity.
        
    - **Use shielding:** Temporarily shield devices with aluminum foil or other shielding materials to check for noise reduction.
        
    - **Rationale:** Correlating the noise to device activity confirms the source of interference.
        
4. **Step 3:** Use a portable AM radio to locate strong signals.
    
    - Walk around the area and listen for the strongest interference signals near suspected devices.
        
    - **Rationale:** AM radios excel at detecting localized pulsed signals.
        
5. **Step 4:** Mitigation:
    
    - Adjust frequencies or replace the device with a quieter alternative.
        
    - Use ferrite chokes or shielding where applicable.
        
    - **Rationale:** Once identified, mitigation targets the specific interference mechanism.
