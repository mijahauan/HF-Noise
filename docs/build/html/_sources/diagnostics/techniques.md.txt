# **Techniques**

1. **Move and Reorient Antenna:**
    
    - Radiated noise will change in intensity and direction.
        
2. **Isolate Components:**
    
    - ConsiderÂ disconnecting devices one by one to pinpoint ground loop sources.
        
3. **Switch to Battery Power:**
    
    - Eliminates AC power-ground interactions.
        
4. **Track Harmonics:**
    
    - Harmonic relationships can reveal the source of noise:
        
        - Harmonics are integer multiples of a fundamental frequency.
            
        - For example, if you observe spikes at 10 MHz, 20 MHz, and 30 MHz, the fundamental source is likely 10 MHz.
            
        - Using the harmonic spacing, trace back to devices operating at the fundamental frequency.
            
5. **Short the Balanced Antenna at the Feedline:**
    
    - If noise persists, it suggests common-mode ingress.
        
6. **Disconnect the Antenna from the Feedline:**
    
    - Persistence of noise may indicate feedline radiation issues.
        
7. **Disconnect the Antenna from the Receiver:**
    
    - If noise remains, it may be invading the radio circuitry directly.
        
8. **Touch the Radio or Connector Shields:**
    
    - Loose or floating grounds can introduce noise; check for stability.
        
9. **Test with a Different Antenna:**
    
    - Determine if the noise source is antenna-specific.
        
10. **Use Multiple Receiving Systems:**
    
    - Cross-check whether the noise is present in different setups to rule out local receiver issues.
