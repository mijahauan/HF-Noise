# Noise Source Localization Techniques

These techniques help pinpoint sources of interference, whether from external sources or within the operator’s station.

## Direction-Finding Methods
### Use of Directional Antennas
#### Examples: Small loops, Yagi antennas, ferrite rod antennas.
#### Usage:
	•	Rotate the antenna to find the direction of maximum and minimum signal strength.
	•	Small loops are particularly good for detecting power line noise.
### Triangulation
#### Usage:
	•	Move to different locations and take readings from different angles.
	•	Plot signal strength readings on a map to narrow down the source.

## Noise-Hunting with Portable Receivers
### Handheld AM Radios
#### Usage:
	•	Tune to a quiet frequency and walk around with the radio.
	•	Noise gets louder near the source.
### HF Portable Receivers (e.g., Tecsun, Sony models)
#### Usage:
	•	Useful for detecting power line noise and other broadband interference.

## Controlled Power-Down Testing
### Sequential Power-Off Technique
#### Usage:
	•	Turn off all devices in the home/station.
	•	Turn them on one by one to isolate noise sources.
### Battery-Powered Operation Test
#### Usage:
	•	Run the radio station on battery power.
	•	If noise disappears, the source is within the station’s electrical system.

## Conducted vs. Radiated Noise Testing
### Check for Conducted Noise:
	•	Disconnect the antenna but leave the feedline connected.
	•	If noise remains, it’s conducted through power lines or feedlines.
### Check for Radiated Noise:
	•	Use a small loop antenna close to suspected devices.
	•	If noise strength changes with distance, it’s radiated.
