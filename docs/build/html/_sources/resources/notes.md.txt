# **Further Notes and Suggestions**

From Glenn N6GN:
> "If one starts with a video+audio of the fundamental of a leaking SMPS, say a bipolar one switching at 30 kHz but having the residual imperfectly filter 120 Hz riding on the DC it is chopping, along with imprecise chop rate, it isn't CW it's spread with noise, say 1 kHz wide 'bump' at 30 kHz  so angular modulation index, beta = deviation/rate so maybe .01 or so, then shows that the chopper is essentially a frequency multiplier, I think many could understand it.   Then go up to 30 MHz and listen in FM with a 10 kHz BW.  Up there  each of the ~1000th+- harmonics in the region now has its line but because its an FM signal the deviation is now 1 MHz. Both it and neighbors within 500 kHz contribute to energy there.  There is no longer any relatively narrow bump to look at or even recognize, just spread noise due to 30 similar lines - each of which is coherently switched at exactly the same instant.  
> 
> The result is a spread noise floor that can look flat but is actually due to the noise spectrum around the original 30 kHz line summed a whole lot of times.  It may look like noise, and someone might mistakenly think it's normal BUT if you listen to it even in a 10 kHz wide AM BW the 120 Hz component due to the residual jumps out at you.  It isn't necessarily noticed in SSB mode.

> Related to that, recognize that propagated noise, our goal, has a different characteristic from near-Gaussian or "white" noise. 75 years ago before the age of SMPS if one listened from a quiet location to 20m the propagated noise had distinctive qualities. This due to the impulse nature of the finite nature of the less-than-a-jillion T-storm strikes that contributed to it.  It sounded "crackly". That's not what one hears at a site that is limited by spread SMPS noise.  Until you listen (and look for diurnal variations characteristic of propagated mostly-Tstorm noise  you may not recognize the difference.  
> 
> If the video played AM from a SMPS fundamental and then went up to, say, the high end of HF where things are spread as described above, the 120 Hz (FW rectification) component due to the residual will show the effect and hum/buzz/growl that is its signature. Then go to KPH or some other quiet site with high diurnal variations which indicate that it is not limited by spread SMPS noise and let the viewer/listener compare the demodulated noise.  
> 
> Oldtime geezers will immediately get the distinction. Newer amateurs will get it when they see/hear it  
> 
> Try it on your own system where there is a bump visible at ~2.6 MHz. Listen to 2600 in AM mode then add a zero and listen at 26000."
