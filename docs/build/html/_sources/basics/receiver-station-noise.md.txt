# Receiver & Station-Generated Noise

Internal noise sources that degrade reception.
# Thermal Noise
	•	Source: Random electron motion in components.
	•	Characteristics: Uniform, white-noise-like across frequencies.
	•	Identification: Measured as receiver noise figure.
	•	Mitigation: Use low-noise amplifiers (LNAs), minimize resistance in circuits.
# Common Mode Current Noise
	•	Source: Poor grounding, unbalanced feedlines.
	•	Characteristics: Appears as unwanted signals on coaxial shields.
	•	Identification: Measured with a current probe, changes with grounding.
	•	Mitigation: Use common-mode chokes, proper station grounding.
# Intermodulation & Mixing Products
	•	Source: Nonlinear components like corroded metal contacts.
	•	Characteristics: Creates phantom signals from real transmissions.
	•	Identification: Signals appear at sums/differences of strong stations.
	•	Mitigation: Remove corroded components, use high-quality connectors.
