# Noise Categories

## Radiated Noise

### Mechanism
Noise emitted through the air from a source and coupled directly into an antenna or receiver.

### Characteristics
* Frequency-dependent
* Changes with antenna orientation and location
* Typically diminishes with distance from the source

### Examples
* Switched-mode power supplies (SMPS)
* LED drivers
* Solar inverters

### Tools for Diagnosis
* Directional antennas (e.g., small loop antenna)
* Spectrum analyzer
* Portable AM radio

### Mitigation Techniques
* Improve shielding of noisy devices
* Use ferrite chokes on power and signal cables
* Replace noisy devices with RF-quiet alternatives

## Noise Due to Ground Loops

### Mechanism
Circulating currents caused by differences in ground potential between connected devices.

### Characteristics
* Frequency-independent or low-frequency hum, sometimes modulating HF signals
* Independent of antenna movement or reorientation
* Strongly influenced by physical connections and layout

### Examples
* Poorly grounded systems
* Multiple grounding points with potential differences

### Tools for Diagnosis
* Multimeter or oscilloscope to measure ground potential differences
* Isolation tests by disconnecting components
* Temporary use of battery power

### Mitigation Techniques
* Ensure a single, low-impedance grounding point
* Use isolation transformers
* Install balanced audio or RF isolators
