# Natural Noise Sources

These are inherent to the environment and cannot be eliminated but can be mitigated.
## Atmospheric Noise (Static)
	•	Source: Lightning, thunderstorms, natural electrical discharges.
	•	Characteristics: Bursts of static, most prominent below 30 MHz.
	•	Identification: Increases during storms, varies seasonally.
	•	Mitigation: Use directional antennas, signal averaging, and DSP noise blankers.
## Ionospheric Noise & Effects
	•	Source: Solar activity, geomagnetic storms, auroral events.
	•	Characteristics: Causes signal fading, warbling, or absorption.
	•	Identification: Correlates with solar indices (Kp, A indices), satellite data.
	•	Mitigation: Operate on frequencies less affected (e.g., NVIS for low bands, higher frequencies during storms).
## Galactic Noise
	•	Source: The Sun, Jupiter, and background cosmic radiation.
	•	Characteristics: Affects VHF/UHF bands, appears as steady broadband noise.
	•	Identification: Stronger when pointing an antenna at certain celestial objects.
	•	Mitigation: Use directional antennas to avoid pointing at strong sources.Dk:1
