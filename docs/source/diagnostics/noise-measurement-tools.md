# Noise Measurement Tools

Once noise is detected, these tools quantify its characteristics.

## Spectrum Analyzers

### Examples: Rigol DSA815, Siglent SSA3021X, TinySA.

### Usage:
- Measures signal strength over a range of frequencies.
- Helps identify noise sources by their frequency signature.

## Field Strength Meters

### Usage:
- Measures RF power levels at different locations.
- Useful for determining noise intensity around potential sources.


## Current Probes & RF Clamp Meters

### Usage:
- Measures common-mode current on cables and feedlines.
- Helps detect conducted emissions from power supplies and electronics.
