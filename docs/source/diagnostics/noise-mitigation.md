# Noise Mitigation Techniques

Once noise sources are identified, the following techniques can help reduce interference.
## Ferrite Chokes & Toroids
### Examples: Mix 31 and Mix 43 ferrites.
### Usage:
	•	Clamp onto power cables, coaxial cables, and data lines to reduce conducted noise.
## Common-Mode Chokes
### Usage:
	•	Install on feedlines to prevent unwanted RF pickup.
## Shielding & Filtering
### Usage:
	•	Use metal enclosures for noisy electronics.
	•	Add RF filters to switching power supplies.
## Antenna Placement & Orientation
### Usage:
	•	Move antennas away from noise sources.
	•	Use balanced antennas to minimize common-mode pickup.
