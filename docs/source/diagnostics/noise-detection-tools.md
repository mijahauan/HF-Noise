# Noise Detection Tools

These tools help recognize the presence of noise and characterize its impact on reception.
## Software-Defined Radios (SDRs)
### Examples: RTL-SDR, Airspy, HackRF, SDRplay, Perseus.
### Usage:
	•	Provides a visual waterfall display of noise patterns.
	•	Helps recognize constant, periodic, or intermittent interference.
	•	Can be used with directional antennas for noise hunting.
## Analog Receivers (AM, SSB, CW-capable radios)
### Examples: General coverage shortwave receivers, handheld AM radios.
### Usage:
	•	AM mode is highly sensitive to impulse noise.
	•	SSB/CW mode helps analyze weak noise patterns.
	•	Portable radios help in field noise hunting.
## Oscilloscope with FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) Capability
### Usage:
	•	Visualizes noise signals in both time and frequency domains.
	•	Helps detect transient and impulse noise sources.
