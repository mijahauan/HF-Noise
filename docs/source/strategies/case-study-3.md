# Case Study 3: Periodic Short-Duration Pops in Audio

## Symptom:
- Random popping or clicking sounds in the receiver audio.
- No specific pattern but seems linked to household activity.

## Analysis:
- This suggests impulse noise from electrical switching events.
- Likely culprits: Thermostats, refrigerators, motor brushes, or light switches.

## Mitigation Steps:
1.	Identify the Source:
- Listen in AM mode on a quiet frequency.
- Have someone turn appliances on/off and note when the noise occurs.
2.	Suppress Arcing Devices:
- Add capacitor snubbers (RC networks) across relay contacts.
- Replace old motors or switches with modern, filtered versions.
3.	Improve Station Filtering:
- Use ferrite clamps on power leads of affected devices.
- Install a mains power filter for the radio stationâ€™s AC line.
