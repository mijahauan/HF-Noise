# Case Study 4: Repeating Spectral Humps at 1.8MHz Intervals

## Symptom:
	•	Wavy noise peaks appear every 1.8 MHz, gradually decreasing in amplitude up to 9 MHz.
	•	The pattern is consistent but changes when unplugging a certain device.

## Analysis:
	•	This pattern suggests harmonics of a switching power supply.
	•	Many cheap wall warts, LED drivers, and computer chargers generate harmonic noise.

## Mitigation Steps:
	1.	Identify the Device:
	•	Unplug switching power supplies one at a time and observe changes in the waterfall.
	2.	Replace or Shield:
	•	If a device is the culprit, swap it for a linear power supply.
	•	If replacement isn’t possible, add ferrite chokes (Mix 43 for VHF, Mix 31 for HF) to the DC output.
	3.	Filter the Power Line:
	•	Use an AC line filter to block conducted emissions.
