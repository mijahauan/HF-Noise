# Digital & Communication-Related Noise

Interference from digital transmissions.
## Broadband Data Emissions (PLC, DSL, Ethernet)
- Source: Power line communication devices, Ethernet over unshielded cables.
- Characteristics: Continuous broadband hash across HF bands.
- Identification: Peaks around known DSL/PLC frequencies.
- Mitigation: Use shielded cables, distance antennas from sources.
## Switching Digital Logic Noise
- Source: Microcontrollers, SDR devices, USB hubs.
- Characteristics: Spikes at processor clock frequencies.
- Identification: Measured using an SDR waterfall.
- Mitigation: Use proper shielding, move RF-sensitive equipment away from computers.
